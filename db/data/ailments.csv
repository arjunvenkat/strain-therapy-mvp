ADHD/ADD,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder,,,,"* Prescription Drugs: 237,485 + 5000 traffic fatalities",,,https://www.hellomd.com/health-wellness/fighting-add-adhd-with-medical-marijuana,"Although not completely understood, ADHD/ADD seems to result from a dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmitter release and uptake. Dopamine receptors interact with the endocannabinoid system in many parts of the brain, which makes medical marijuana a possible treatment option for those suffering from ADHD/ADD. Cannabinoid receptors are concentrated in the amygdala and hippocampus areas of the brain. Those areas are linked strongly with attention deficit disorders, high anxiety, depression, and phobias. These centers also have a high concentration of CB1 receptors, which cannabis can target to help control these symptoms. Recent research into marijuana use by those with ADHD/ADD supports the theory that cannabis can be an effective treatment for ADHD, although there is still a scarcity of formal studies on the topic."
Alcoholism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism,,,,"* Tobacco: 390,323",,,https://www.whaxy.com/learn/cannabis-treament-for-alcoholism,"The late Dr. Tod Mikuriya was a strong advocate of medical cannabis for a variety of therapeutic applications, including the treatment of alcohol dependence. Mikuriya published a study in 2004 that involved 92 patients, all of whom had been prescribed cannabis as a treatment for alcohol dependence. As could be expected among patients seeking physician approval to treat alcoholism with cannabis, all reported that they’d found it ‘very effective’ (45) or ‘effective’ (38). Efficacy was inferred from other responses on seven questionnaires. Nine patients reported that they had practiced total abstinence from alcohol for more than a year and attributed their success to cannabis. Their years in sobriety: 19, 18, 16, 10, 7, 6, 4 (2), and 2."
ALS (Lou Gehrig's),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis,,,,"* Alcohol: 88,013 + 16,000 traffic fatalities    substitute:  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305713002104",,,http://www.safeaccessnow.org/is_medical_marijuana_the_solution_for_als,"The benefits of Cannabis to treat ALS is prevalent in anecdotal evidence, but basic laboratory and animal research suggests that THC may be the first (and only?) naturally occurring, non-toxic, anti-oxidant to slow the progressions of the disease significantly. In addition to delaying the progression of disease and increasing life-span cannabinoids treatments may offer other benefits include sleep induction, appetite stimulation, saliva reduction, bronchodilation, analgesia, and muscle relaxation (Carter). The human clinical studies on THC-only Cannabis are limited by sample size. Research regulations for clinical use of THC also make it difficult to recruit ALS patients in a timely manner for a controlled study. Despite these significant obstacles, two human studies have been conducted. One of the studies, was a pilot study investigating the safety and tolerability of THC in ALS patients (Gelinas/ABood 2002). This clinical study confirmed symptomatic benefits for appetite, insomnia, and spasticity. The second research study was conducted as an anonymous survey in 80 countries, 131 surveys were completed, and the mean age 54. Participants reported that Cannabis helped provide relief from drooling, speech and swallowing difficulty, appetite loss, weakness, shortness of breath, spasticity, depression, and pain (Amtmann D 2004). In animals with ALS, THC administered either before or after the onset of the disease delayed motor impairment and prolonged survival. Furthermore, THC potently reduced oxidative and excite-toxic damage in spinal cord cultures in vitro (Raman et al. 2004). The protective effects of cannabinoids and their anti-spastic effects in MS are well known (Carter 2001). Furthermore, cannabinoid receptors are up-regulated in human tissue during disease progression, making them an abundant target for treatment."
Alzheimer’s Disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease,,,,,664.3424658,166.0856164,http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2014/11/29/marijuana-fights-alzheimers-disease-study-indicates/,"Alzheimer’s Disease is thought to result from a lifetime of brain inflammation. Cannabis is one of the most safe anti-inflammatories in medicine. Some neuroscientists believe a bout of pot smoking in early adulthood may prevent Alzheimer’s onset later in life. Cannabis slows brain aging, Time reported in 2012. Smoking, vaping, or eating the pot molecules THC and CBD directly effects nerve cell function, reducing chronic brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular dysfunction — all the while promoting stability of the human body’s internal environment (homeostasis) and healthy brain cells (neurotrophic support), studies show. “What we found was that not only did the single puff a day reverse the memory impairment but also restarted neurogenesis,” Ohio State University, Gary Wenk told the Seattle Post Intelligencer this year. Other studies have shown THC inhibits other key pathological markers of Alzheimer’s Disease."
Anorexia (eating disorders),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa,,,,,1069.378082,267.3445205,http://420insight.com/medicinal/eating-disorders-and-medical-cannabis/,"In 2011, a study reported in Biological Psychology found that the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS) influences a person’s mood and response to food. It was also found that those with anorexia and bulimia had impaired or particularly underactive endocannabinoid systems. The ECS is a system of cannabinoid receptors (namely CB1 and CB2) found on the surfaces of some of the cells in our bodies. The CB1 receptors are found mainly in brain cells, but also throughout the body, while the CB2 receptors are located in the cells of certain organs and deal primarily with the body’s immune system.  The body naturally produces its own endogenous cannabinoids, Anandamide and 2-Arachidonyl-glycerol (2AG), to stimulate the CB1 and CB2 receptors. The goal of the ECS is to stabilize the body’s internal environment in response to the body’s external environment. One of these stabilizing forces is appetite – when the body needs fuel, it gets hungry. We often get this impulse from the Anandamide and 2AG cannabinoids in breast milk during infancy. These cannabinoids stimulate our appetites. Some researchers believe that EDs are linked to a dysfunctional ECS, which can be rectified through medical cannabis. People with anorexia or bulimia have hypersensitive CB1 receptor functions that influence body awareness, whereas the receptors associated with pleasure in eating seem to be stunted."
Anxiety Disorders,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder,,,,,284.9671233,142.4835616,http://www.anxietysocialnet.com/anxiety-and-medical-marijuana,"When taking a close look at medical studies and results of medical marijuana used to treat anxiety, it’s evident that the chemical makeup, specifically the presence of the chemical compound Cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, is the main ingredient to treat anxiety. Certain medical marijuana strains with higher levels of CBD have proven to help treat anxiety disorders. The CBD produces therapeutic affects for patients and can also help pa tients with Crohn’s Disease or glaucoma. Animal studies suggest that CBD present in cannabis lessens anxiety and reduces the severity and frequency of seizures. According to a study published by the Institute of Psychiatry, CBD proved to offer great psychiatric potential, including uses as an antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like compound. During the study, animals who had been given CBD experienced lower levels of anxiety and depression in a series of tests, such as swimming and puzzle mazes, than animals who had not been given CBD. Another study aimed to investigate the use of CBD for treating a social anxiety disorder. The study, published by the Department of Neurosciences and Behavior, Division of Psychiatry, found that CBD was associated with significantly decreased subjective anxiety. The study states that in the first session, subjects were given an oral does of CBD or placebo. Results suggested that CBD reduced anxiety in social anxiety disorder patients because it is related to CBD’s effects on activity in specific mood-altering brain areas."
Arthritis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis,,,,,lives saved per day,576,https://www.whaxy.com/learn/best-cannabis-for-arthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis and occurs when a person’s cartilage simply wears away. It can affect the knees, hips, lower back, hands, and neck. Osteoarthritis is basically a sign of aging and quite common. Unfortunately, no cure exists. Treatments like cannabis have been shown to reduce swelling in the joints and relieve pain for osteoarthritis sufferers. Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune condition that attacks the joints. Think of RA as a faulty immune system. The disease can cause severe debilitation for sufferers of all ages, as well as a slew of other immune system-related health problems. There are two cannabinoids found in marijuana that have especially profound efficacy for those with arthritis: CBD and THC. CBD, or cannabidiol, is responsible for immune system modulation, meaning it is helpful for an autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol — and byproducts of its metabolism — has been found to be anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain killing). THC is also known to reduce the anxiety and depression that commonly accompany severe diseases, especially those that affect one’s mobility."
Asthma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma,,,,,lives saved per year,"210,209",http://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/top-6-benefits-of-cannabis-for-asthma/,"Asthma is considered to be a chronic inflammatory condition, as persistent, low-level inflammation has been found to occur in the bronchi and bronchioles even during non-attack circumstances. During an attack, levels of inflammation increase, exacerbating the levels of constriction caused by muscular contractions of the bronchial tissue. Asthma-related inflammation is generally thought to be an immune response to the presence of allergens, although the immune response has not been definitively ascertained and may differ greatly between individuals. Cannabinoids are well-known for their anti-inflammatory effects, and while most studies thus far into cannabis and asthma have focused primarily on the bronchodilatory effect, some have also observed a reduction in bronchial inflammation. Furthermore, cannabis is currently being investigated for its ability to produce targeted therapies for immune-modulated inflammatory diseases. Cannabinoid receptors have been found in human lung tissue, although in relatively low concentrations, and are thought to play a vital role in the regulation of inflammation, muscular contractions and dilations, and various metabolic processes. However, research into the immune-modulated inflammatory response (and how cannabis may assist it) is in its infancy."
Autism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism,,,,,,,https://www.whaxy.com/learn/cannabis-treatment-autism,"Some forms of autism are believed to result from an insufficient amount ofendocannabinoids, the body’s own healthy molecules that are very similar to phytocannabinoids like THC and CBD provided by herbs like cannabis. A lack of endocannabinoids has been labeled endocannabinoid deficiency and is known to be responsible for a multitude of diseases and conditions. It is theorized that this dysfunction in the production of proper levels of endocannabinoids may be one of the primary causes of autism. The Autism Research Institute believes that many symptoms of autism can be mitigated through the use of properly titrated (dosed) cannabis: “Some of the symptoms medical marijuana has ameliorated include: Anxiety — even severe anxiety — aggression, panic disorder, generalized rage, tantrums, property destruction, and self-injurious behavior.” Another study from 2013 that was published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders revealed a link between the endocannabinoid system and immune cells in children with autism. Because immune dysfunction is a factor that contributes to autism, the condition is believed to be linked to higher levels of CB2 receptors in cells (CB1 receptors, on the contrary, were not overexpressed). CB2 receptors play a significant role in regulation of the immune system. Because problems with the immune system are so closely related to autism, the authors of the study concluded that the use of cannabinoids and therapies that target CB2 receptors might be helpful for those who suffer from ASD."
Bipolar Disorder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder,,,,,,,https://www.hellomd.com/health-wellness/a-natural-mood-stabilizer-medical-marijuana-can-help-fight-bipolar-disorder,"While the causes of bipolar affective disorder are not clear, it is thought to have a strong genetic component. It could also be related to physical changes in the brain.Magnetic resonance images (MRI) have shown that the brains of those with bipolar affective disorder have ""decreases in the volume of the brain's prefrontal cortex and its subcortical connections sites, including the amygdala."" The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision making and behavior, while the amygdala is responsible for emotions, mood and motivation. All of these functions are affected by bipolar disorder. Nerve cells communicate through neurochemicals at synapses. Endocannabinoids, which are naturally occurring chemicals in the body that are similar to the cannabinoids in medical marijuana, influence synaptic action and help to maintain the brain's chemical balance. Research has shown that cannabis can help restore synaptic action, reducing pain and spasticity. In a literature review, researchers from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom examined the relationship between cannabinoids and bipolar affective disorder. They concluded that both tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) from medical marijuana are similar to standard medications being used to treat bipolar affective disorder. Based on this finding and the mounting evidence that THC and CBD can affect synaptic action, the researchers feel that patients with bipolar affective disorder could benefit from medical marijuana."
Bladder Cancer/Dysfunction,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer,,,,,,,http://www.healthnutnews.com/national-cancer-institute-finally-admits-thc-causes-45-remission-in-bladder-breast-and-liver-cancer/,"The National Cancer Institute recently released its report on medical marijuana. The overview of their conclusion is, THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) caused a 45 percent reduction in bladder cancer, remission in breast and liver cancer and more. - Among their findings, they have found that cannabis is not associated with adverse pulmonary function and does not cause lung cancer or any aerodigestive tract cancers. Cannabis does not cause other types of cancer either. - See more at: http://www.healthnutnews.com/national-cancer-institute-finally-admits-thc-causes-45-remission-in-bladder-breast-and-liver-cancer/#sthash.lJjXebHo.dpuf"

Glioma accounts for 80 percent of malignant brain tumors in humans. ""We've shown that cannabinoids could play a role in treating one of the most aggressive cancers in adults,"" Dr. Wai Liu, lead author of the study, wrote in an op-ed for the Huffington Post last year. Previous studies have shown that THC may have anti-tumor benefits, but the wrong dose can potentially increase the size of tumors."
Breast Cancer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer,,,,,,,http://www.attn.com/stories/2189/medical-marijuana-treating-breast-cancer,"According to research from the California Pacific Medical Research Center published last year, CBD, the non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis, can help inhibit metastasis in breast cancer cells. Metastasis is a tumor's ability to spread throughout the body. ""We have found [CBD] inhibits key genes involved in tumor progression and metastasis,"" Dr. Sean McAllister, a lead research in the study, told ATTN: McAllister claims CBD appears to inhibit the Id-1 and Akt genes, which have been known to play a role in the progress of tumor growth. McAllister and his fellow researchers have studied this concept for years, with their first published work appearing in 2007. McAllister explained to media outlets at the time that treatments such as chemotherapy can be effective for some patients, but they are not always effective for everyone. Beyond that, intense chemotherapy treatments can come with crippling side effects like pain and vomiting."
Cerebral Palsy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy,,,,,,,https://www.marijuanadoctors.com/content/ailments/view/100?ailment=cerebral-palsy,"All types of cerebral palsy can be characterzied best by abnormal muscle tone, reflexes, motor development and coordination. In certain cases, there can be joint and bone deformities and contractures. The classical symptoms associated with cerebral palsy are spasticities, spasms, other involuntary movements, unsteady gait, problems with balance and soft tissue finding consisting largely of decreased muscle mass. Medical marijuana is a great treatment option for those who suffer from cerebral palsy, mainly because of it's direct ability to alleviate any symptoms of spasticity that one may experience. Medical marijauna serves as a muscle relaxer and can also provide exceptional anti-inflammatory properties that you cannot find anywhere else. This type of alternative treatment option also alleviates chronic pain associated with this condition and any form of stiffness."
Chronic Pain,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_pain,,,,,,,http://www.medicaljane.com/2014/06/13/chronic-pain-and-the-theraputic-benefits-of-medical-cannabis/,"The use of cannabis to treat chronic pain has had a long history, with written references of its use dating back to around 2700 B.C.E. The first records in the nineteenth century were recorded by the Irish doctor William B. O’Shaughnessy, who described the use of cannabis in the treatment of cholera, rabies, tetanus, menstrual cramps and delirium tremens. “Medical cannabis is a very effective therapy for chronic pain patients because it affects people’s perception of pain, has the ability to mitigate the inflammatory process, and has been shown to affect voltage-gated sodium channels in nerves in a way similar to lidocaine,” reports Dr. Mark Rabe, Medical Director of Centric Wellness, am integrative holistic healthcare practice in San Diego CA and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at Medical Marijuana Sciences, Inc."
Chronic Stress,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress,,,,,,,http://www.attn.com/stories/3233/what-cannabis-does-to-anxiety,"""Chronic stress or acute, severe emotional trauma can cause a reduction in both the production of endocannabinoids and the responsiveness of the receptors,"" the researchers wrote in a press release about the study. Because components of marijuana function as endocannabinoids, cannabis can, in fact, provide relief by contributing to the system—centrally located in the amygdala—that regulates anxiety, they continued."
Colon Cancer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer,,,,,,,http://www.leafscience.com/2014/01/03/cbd-rich-cannabis-may-fight-colon-cancer-study-shows/,"Cannabidiol (CBD), a compound in cannabis, shows promise as a treatment for a variety of cancers. Now, for the first time, researchers have found that cannabis rich in CBD can slow the progress of colon cancer in live animal models.  Using a botanical extract made from high-CBD cannabis, researchers from Italy and the UK were able to reduce pre-cancerous lesions and tumor growth in mice with colon cancer. The results, released last month in the journal Phytomedicine, also suggest that cannabis extract can selectively target colon cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unharmed. Both CB1 and CB2 pathways seem to facilitate its effects."
COPD,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease,,,,,,,http://naturalsociety.com/cannabis-oil-proving-successful-another-incurable-disease-copd/#ixzz3uQ51WUPB,"The treatment situation is so bleak with mainstream medicine that those desperate to breathe normally and experience less coughing with mucus have turned to medical marijuana for at least some relief without negative side effects. Smoking marijuana joints is shunned for obvious reasons, but many claim that vaping, or using a vaporizer to inhale cannabis, is useful for COPD without exacerbating the lungs’ inflammatory condition."
Crohn's Disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease,,,,,,,https://www.hellomd.com/health-wellness/cannabis-shows-promise-as-a-treatment-for-crohn-s-disease-and-colitis,"As is true with many disorders, cannabis has been used for centuries to treat the symptoms of Crohn's Disease and Colitis. The reason that cannabis is an effective treatment for these disorders is that cannabis can significantly limit intestinal inflammation. According to a statement issued by The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America in 2012, compounds found in the marijuana plant closely mimicendocannabinoids (molecules that occur naturally in the body) and have been shown to play an important part in decreasing gastrointestinal inflammation."
Depression,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder,,,,,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/06/marijauna-depression_n_6622126.html,"In studies, the researchers found that chronic stress reduced the production of endocannabinoids, which affect our cognition, emotion and behavior, and have been linked to reduced feelings of pain and anxiety, increases in appetite and overall feelings of well-being. The body naturally produces these compounds, which are similar to the chemicals in cannabis. Reduction of endocannabinoid production may be one reason that chronic stress is a major risk factor in the development of depression. Then, the research team administered marijuana cannabinoids to the rats, finding it to be an effective way to restore endocannabinoid levels in their brains -- possibly, thereby, alleviating some symptoms of depression."
Diabetes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus,,,,,,,http://www.letfreedomgrow.com/cmu/diabetes_5.htm,"Cannabis is also neuroprotective. It is believed that much of neuropathy comes from the inflammation of nerves caused by glycoproteins in the blood that deposit in peripheral tissues and trigger an immune response. Cannabis helps protect the nerve covering (myelin sheath) from inflammatory attack. Cannabis also lessens the pain of neuropathy by activating receptors in the body and brain. Some components of cannabis (perhaps cannibidiol) act as anti-spasmodic agents similar to the far more toxic anti-convulsants like Neurontin. This action of cannabis helps relieve diabetic muscle cramps and GI upset. Two other major actions of cannabis can benefit the diabetic. The first is helping to keep blood vessels open and improving circulation. Cannabis is a vasodilator and works well to improve blood flow. The second action is how cannabis can reduce blood pressure over time. While cannabis is not generally thought to be an anti-hypertensive and is no replacement for ACE inhibitors, it does contribute to lower blood pressure which is vital in diabetes management. Finally, cannabis used in food products not only provides long lasting blood levels of key cannabinoids but, in addition, cannabis butter and oil substitute triple bonded fatty acids for the saturated fats normally contained in these essential cooking products. This substitution will benefit cardiac and arterial health in general."
Disc Degeneration,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disc_disease,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4269422/,"Disc degeneration is a multifactorial process that involves hypoxia, inflammation, neoinnervation, accelerated catabolism, and reduction in water and glycosaminoglycan content. Cannabidiol is the main non-psychotropic component of the Cannabis sativa with protective and anti-inflammatory properties.  In summary our study revealed anti-degenerative effects of intradiscal microinjection of CBD 120 nmol. CBD represents one of the most promising candidates present in the Cannabis sativa plant for clinical use due to its remarkable lack of cognitive or psychotomimetic actions. It has been already approved in several countries for the treatment of neuropathic pain [63]. Although further research is necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in CBD effects, the present results suggest the possibility of its use for disc degeneration treatment."
Epilepsy & Seizures,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy,,,,,,,http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/news/20150413/liquid-medical-marijuana-shows-promise-against-severe-epilepsy,"Among the 137 people who completed the study, the number of seizures fell by an average of 54 percent, according to a team led by Dr. Orrin Devinsky, of New York University Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City."
Fibromyalgia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia,,,,,,,https://www.whaxy.com/learn/does-medica-marijuana-treat-fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome that is difficult to treat and has no cure, is no exception. Affecting an estimated 5 to 12 million Americans, the condition is relatively untreatable with conventional pharmaceutical medications. In fact, only 35-40 percent of sufferers gain any relief whatsoever from mainstream drugs. Cannabis treats not only the pain associated with fibromyalgia, but other symptoms of the condition as well, including insomnia, fatigue, restless legs syndrome, depression, and anxiety. While the root cause of fibromyalgia remains a mystery, it is understood that it involves a disturbance in how the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, sends and receives messages. It is estimated that the disease afflicts four to seven times as many women as men."
Glaucoma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma,,,,,,,http://medicalmarijuanainc.com/glaucome-medical-marijuana-research/#sthash.mvP0mxk2.dpuf,"Over multiple decades, scientific research has proven that cannabinoids are effective at decreasing intraocular pressure (Nadolska & Gos, 2008) (Pinar-Sueiro, Rodriguez-Puertas & Vecino, 2011). In addition, the compounds found in cannabis feature neuroprotection and vasodilation properties, which further assist in the conservative treatment of glaucoma (Nadolska & Gos, 2008) (Nucci, et al., 2008). The cannabinoids found in cannabis, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), activate endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 (Pinar-Sueiro, Rodriguez-Puertas & Vecino, 2011). The endocannabinoid receptors located in the structures of the eyes are responsible for the formation and outflow of aqueous humor (Nadolska & Gos, 2008) (Nucci, et al., 2008). Smoking cannabis has demonstrated through numerous studies that it can be effective at lowering intraocular pressure. After inhaling THC, participants with open-angle glaucoma in one study had their blood and intra-ocular pressures decrease for three to four hours (Crawford & Merritt, 1979). Another study found that smoking marijuana lowered blood pressure, which led to a decrease in intra-ocular pressure within 60 to 90 minutes of inhalation (Merritt, et al., 1980). Yet another study found that glaucoma patients experienced a lowering of orthostatic blood pressure, but in just five minutes after smoking marijuana (Merritt, Cook & Davis, 1982)."

The BC-CfE study High-intensity cannabis use associated with lower plasma human immunodeficiency virus-1 RNA viral load among recently infected people who use injection drugs was published in Drug and Alcohol Review in March 2015 and included interviews from 88 individuals in the year following acquisition of the virus participating in the National Institutes of Health-funded study AIDS Care Cohort to evaluate Exposure to Survival Services (ACCESS)."
Huntington’s Disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease,,,,,,,https://www.marijuanadoctors.com/content/ailments/view/143?ailment=huntington-s-disease,"The tension reducing effects of medical marijuana are well known. Numerous studies have been done that show the possible beneficial use of medical marijuana for patients who suffer from tension or anxiety. Cannabidiol, or CMD, is a chemical component found in marijuana and widely believed to be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of marijuana. A recent study, looked at the benefits of medical marijuana on patients suffering from Huntington’s Disease and found that the participants showed a modest improve of symptoms which increased with the amount of the drug they received. Even more promising results were obtained in an animal study. In that study, a mutant strain of hamsters that exhibited the symptoms of dystonia, a sub-group of disorders that share similar characteristics to Huntington’s Disease, were given a synthetic cannabinoid that activates the same cellular receptors as THC. The hamsters showed symptoms of dystonia that included rapid jerky movements or slow, repetitive movements, similar to Huntington’s Disease sufferers. In that study, the hamsters showed a marked reduction of symptoms when under the influence of the synthetic cannabinoid, indicating that medical marijuana may be beneficial to those with Huntington’s Disease."
Hypertension,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension,,,,,,,http://tetrahealthcenters.com/cannabis-and-hypertension/,"While only initial studies have been completed, cannabis appears a very strong contender as a viable treatment for hypertension, as scientists were able to determine that the use of cannabis opens the blood vessels in animals with high blood pressure. Studies on human subjects have also been promising, showing that upon smoking or vaporizing cannabis, the patients’ heart rate will initially accelerate, but then will begin to slow after about ten minutes. Studies on the effects of hypertension have revealed that the most common causes of hypertension are obesity, insomnia, and anxiety. These are each some of the most common ailments for which marijuana has been prescribed as a viable medication. Through treatment of these symptoms cannabis can aid in reducing or even eliminating hypertension completely."
IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome,,,,,,,http://www.crescolabs.com/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/,"Although the exact cause of IBS remains unknown, it is known that, like many physiological processes, the gastrointestinal tract is controlled by the body’s endocannabinoid system. Experts report that the colon muscle of an IBS sufferer is overly sensitive, causing it to spasm after even the most mild stimulation because of a disruption in the communication pathway between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. Cannabis provides significant medical efficacy in the treatment of IBS because it is made up of hundreds of organic chemical compounds, known as cannabinoids, which are able to bind to the same receptors in the brain as the body’s own gastrointestinal tract regulating endocannabinoids. Medical cannabis is able to fill in the missing pieces of the homeostasis puzzle when the body fails to regulate its own endocannabinoid production.  The most abundant psychoactive cannabinoid known for producing the feeling of being high, THC, is also known for being an effective reliever of pain and nausea, which are two of the most common symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. CBD, the most abundant non-psychoactive cannabinoid works is a powerful anti-spasmodic that also produces calming effects in patients.  Experts report that, in the treatment of IBS and many other conditions, the medical efficacy of each individual cannabinoid found in medical cannabis increases dramatically when they work together in a process known as the entourage effect. For example, CBC works synergistically with THC to increase the amount of the gastrointestinal regulating endocannabinoid, anandamide, that is in the body at any given time. More anandamide in the system equates to reduced pain because it prevents excessive spasms in the gut wall."
Inflamation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation,,,,,,,http://medicalmarijuanainc.com/inflammation-2-medical-marijuana-research/#sthash.eAecUG0D.dpuf,"Medical marijuana has been found to be effective at both reducing chronic inflammation and at curtailing the pain associated with inflammatory-related diseases, thanks to its two major cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both THC and CBD have demonstrated success at reducing inflammation related to a variety of conditions. Studies have shown that THC is able to reduce the development of atherosclerosis, the chronic inflammatory disease and a major risk factor of heart attacks and strokes, and at reducing airway inflammation related to the flu virus (Fimiani, et al., 1999) (Buchweitz, et al., 2008). CBD has been found to have the capability of reducing joint inflammation and has demonstrated effective at inhibiting the disease’s progression (Sumariwalla, et al., 2004) (Nagarkatti, et al., 2009). CBD has also shown to effectively reduced edema (Costa, et al., 2004). In terms of Crohn’s disease, cannabis is able to lower the digestive track inflammation and has even demonstrated it can improve the chances of reaching complete remission (Naftali, Mechulam, Lev & Konikoff, 2014) (Nagarkatti, et al., 2009). Studies also suggest that the cannabinoids in marijuana may be beneficial in certain types of cancers that are triggered by chronic inflammation (Nagarkatti, et al., 2009)."
Leukemia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia,,,,,,,http://medicalmarijuanainc.com/leukemia-medical-marijuana-research/#sthash.QLlHRvRr.dpuf,"Evidence suggests that cannabis shows potential as a viable treatment option for leukemia. One of the major cannabinoids found in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to induce apoptosis, or death, of leukemia cells (Powles, et al., 2005) (Murison, et al., 1987) (Scott, Shah, Dalgleish & Liu, 2013). Another major cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), has also been shown to significantly decrease tumor burden and increase the death of cancerous leukemia cells (Gallily, et al., 2003) (McKallip, et al., 2006) (Scott, Shah, Dalgleish & Liu, 2013). Evidence has shown that a greater dose of cannabis is associated with a greater apoptosis response (Gallily, et al., 2003). One study found that combining THC treatment with additional established cytotoxic agents could further enhance leukemia cancer cell death (Liu, et al., 2008). These findings have caused researchers to conclude that cannabis “may be a novel and highly selective treatment for leukemia” (McKallip, et al., 2006). "
Liver Disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_disease,,,,,,,http://medicalmarijuanainc.com/cirrhosis-medical-marijuana-research/#sthash.ZE43JVlH.dpuf,"Research regarding cannabis and its potential impact on cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases is complex. The two major cannabinoids found in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) bind with or influence the cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Previous studies had actually implicated action of CB1 in the progression of cirrhosis, fibrosis, and other liver diseases. However, CB2 receptor activation has shown beneficial effects on alcoholic fatty liver, hepatic inflammation, liver injury, regeneration and fibrosis and CBD has. Therefore, research suggests that using cannabis to selectively activate the CB2 receptor offers therapeutic potential for cirrhosis and other liver diseases (Mallat, et al., 2011). Studies suggest that CBD can help combat cirrhosis progression by assisting in the death of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). When HSCs are activated, they proliferate and produce excess collagen, which causes the accumulation of scarring on the liver. CBD’s activation of the CB2 receptors, however, has been shown to be effective at inducing apoptosis (death) in these activated HSCs (Lim, Devi & Rozenfeld, 2011). Cannabidiol has also been shown to restore liver function in mice experiencing liver failure (Abraham, et al., 2011). Findings also support that CBD can serve as a protective strategy against ischemia reperfusion, the pivotal mechanism of tissue damage in cirrhosis, by reducing the force of key inflammatory pathways and oxidative/nitrative tissue injury. These effects of CBD are independent of their impact on the CB2 receptors (Mukhopadhyay, Rajesh & Pacher, 2011). CBD has also proven effective at protecting the liver from steatosis caused by alcohol drinking by preventing an increase in oxidative stress and the autophagy induced by alcohol, thus protecting the liver from progressive damage (Yang, et al., 2014).

Lung Cancer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer,,,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295214004201,"Cannabinoids have been shown to promote the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on lung cancer cells as part of their anti-invasive and antimetastatic action. Using lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460) and metastatic cells derived from a lung cancer patient, the present study addressed the impact of cannabinoid-induced ICAM-1 on cancer cell adhesion to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, enhanced the susceptibility of cancer cells to adhere to and subsequently be lysed by LAK cells, with both effects being reversed by a neutralizing ICAM-1 antibody. Increased cancer cell lysis by CBD was likewise abrogated when CBD-induced ICAM-1 expression was blocked by specific siRNA or by antagonists to cannabinoid receptors (CB1, CB2) and to transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. In addition, enhanced killing of CBD-treated cancer cells was reversed by preincubation of LAK cells with an antibody to lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) suggesting intercellular ICAM-1/LFA-1 crosslink as crucial event within this process. ICAM-1-dependent pro-killing effects were further confirmed for the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and R(+)-methanandamide (MA), a hydrolysis-stable endocannabinoid analogue. Finally, each cannabinoid elicited no significant increase of LAK cell-mediated lysis of non-tumor bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, associated with a far less pronounced (CBD, THC) or absent (MA) ICAM-1 induction as compared to cancer cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate cannabinoid-induced upregulation of ICAM-1 on lung cancer cells to be responsible for increased cancer cell lysis by LAK cells. These findings provide proof for a novel antitumorigenic mechanism of cannabinoids."
Lupus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus,,,,,,,https://www.whaxy.com/learn/does-cannabis-treat-lupus,"Cannabis is effective against lupus for several reasons. Many of the anti-inflammatory benefits it delivers are closely related to the relief gained by rheumatoid arthritis sufferers who medicate with the herb. Chiefly, marijuana is a very effective analgesic (pain killer) and anti-inflammatory agent. Because the inflammation associated with lupus can produce considerable pain in the hands and knees, cannabis can both treat the source of the symptom — the inflammation and swelling — while also decreasing one of the main symptoms — pain. Some lupus patients report gaining the most efficacy from their symptoms from strains and extracts of cannabis that are high in the non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBD (cannabidiol). Others claim relief from juicing the leaves of cannabis plants, with CBD-rich strains being indicated as more therapeutic. Most strains and concentrates of cannabis are extremely effective at dealing with the nausea experienced by some lupus patients. Those suffering from insomnia should consider smoking or vaporizing a potent indica before sleep."
Lyme Disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease,,,,,,,http://reset.me/story/marijuana-the-super-antibiotic-of-the-future/,"“I was completely debilitated, I could not walk or talk and I was in a wheelchair being spoon-fed.” Shelley says in a YouTube video she posted in September of 2013 that chronicles her healing journey with cannabis oil. “I did antibiotics for over a year” she states, “They did not work for me they worked against me.” “I took a shot in the dark and started using cannabis oil and it worked,” she explains."
Malaria,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria,,,,,,,https://www.whaxy.com/learn/can-cannabis-treat-malaria,"A recent study reveals that cannabis, or one of its constituent cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD), may be effective in preserving and even “rescuing” essential brain function in those who have suffered cerebral malaria. Research published in the journal Neuroscience in March of 2015 reveals that the neuroprotective properties of CBD helped prevent memory deficits and anxiety in laboratory mice. The study revealed that mice not treated with CBD following infection with malaria suffered from memory dysfunction, an increase in anxiety, and inflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex regions of the brain. Mice treated with CBD exhibited no memory deficits, an increase in a brain chemical that protects neurons, and a decrease of inflammation in the brain. Also revealed was the fact that the mice infected with malaria that were treated with CBD lived longer and regained full cognitive functionality — unlike the mice deprived of CBD. However, the study did note that motor function was not recovered in either the group fed CBD or the control group that received none."

MS (Multiple Sclerosis),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778283,"Cannabis can help multiple sclerosis patients manage the symptoms associated with their disease. Cannabis has shown to be effective at reducing pain, muscle stiffness and spasms in multiple sclerosis patients (Koppel, et al., 2014) (Wade, et al., 2004). In one study, multiple sclerosis patients saw significant improvements in muscle spasticity and reduced sleep disturbances after four weeks of cannabis treatment (Novotna, et al., 2011). A similar study found that multiple sclerosis patients experienced pain and sleep improvements after five weeks of treatment with cannabis containing both THC and CBD (Rog, Nurmikko, Friede & Young, 2005). In a questionnaire, multiple sclerosis patients responded that cannabis was effective in improving spasticity, chronic pain of extremities, tremors, emotional dysfunctions, fatigue, double vision, bowel and bladder dysfunctions, dysfunctions of walking and balance and memory loss (Consroe, et al., 1997). - See more at: http://medicalmarijuanainc.com/multiple-sclerosis-medical-marijuana-research/#sthash.qePAnGcD.dpuf"
